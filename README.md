# OpenGameband
Replacement for the Gameband Launcher 
This project is an open source replacement of the Gameband + Minecraft launcher.

# Status
So far it can launch the minecraft launcher on macOS. 
At some point a PixelForge replacement will be implemented, though this requires some reverse engineering effort.
